      <h2> Personas and Storyboarding - Washer/Dryer Interface</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="header-text">
      <p>
        For this project, I practiced persona making and storyboarding as a means
        to understand the users of an interface. First, I observed and interviewed
        users of my chosen interface—the controls of my apartment's washer/dryer. Then,
        I developed two personas based on the data I collected. Lastly, I created a
        storyboard for one of the personas, illustrating a user experience from start
        to end.

      <h3> Part 1: Preparation </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="part">
        I first selected my interface. I chose the controls to my washer/dryer because
        it's in public view, and because its confusing components would provide substantial
        material for observation and interviews. Here is a sketch of the washer/dryer controls:

      <div class="img">
        <img src="Laundry_Sketch.jpg" width="600" height="297">
      </div>

      <p>
        This interface is meant for users to control how they would like to wash and dry
        their clothes. Two main dials control the mode in which the washer or dryer will
        run, with additional dials to control other wash options. Three buttons (two wash,
        one dry) function to start the wash/dry cycles. As the sketch shows, this interface
        is packed with knobs, buttons, and many, many labels.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also prepared a list of questions to ask the users during interviews.
      </p>
      <ol id="questions">
        <li> What is your first reaction to the laundry machine controls? </li>
        <li> In terms of settings, how would you prefer to wash and dry your clothes? </li>
        <li> What options do you expect to have for laundry machine controls? </li>
        <li> Is there anything confusing about how to operate the laundry machine? </li>
        <li> How do you feel about doing laundry? </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

      <h3> Part 2: Recording Observations </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="part">
        Next, over a few days, I observed my roommates operating the washer/dryer
        and interviewed them using the questions above.

      <div class="user">
        <h4> Sophie </h4>
        Observations:
        <ul>
          <li> Plays Among Us on her phone while doing laundry </li>
          <li> Places all of her clothes into the washer </li>
          <li> Chooses heavy colors for wash </li>
          <li> Chooses optimum cottons for dry </li>
        </ul>
        Interview responses:
        <ol>
          <li>
            I don’t like the dials, but I guess it makes sense since it's like a
            timer. I can’t imagine why anyone would want to know the wash status.
            I've never used the options dial.
          </li>
          <li>
            The settings are so arbitrary to me. I don’t have that many nice clothes
            so I can just do whatever. I usually do a huge load, so that's why I chose
            heavy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Temperature, something about cycle length. Maybe materials or weight?
          </li>
          <li>
            Yeah, the status lights make no sense. And why do I have to choose between
            delicates and colors? The dryer has a lot of words. What's easy care?
            What's quick fluff 10??
          </li>
          <li>
            It's whatever. I don't know what I'm doing, but nothing's gone bad yet.
            I like having it out of the way, I guess.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="user">
        <h4> Emily </h4>
        Observations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            "I haven’t done laundry in so long. I’m not gonna be able to fit
            this all in one load… that’s so sad."
          </li>
          <li> Squints at the washer dial for a while </li>
          <li> Chooses medium colors for first batch </li>
          <li> Uses same setting for second batch </li>
          <li> “Could I get my towels and put them in here? Yes. Will I? No.” </li>
          <li>
            Chooses 70 min timed dry for all clothes, awkwardly twisting her hand
            to reach it
          </li>
        </ul>
        Interview responses:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first time I did laundry here, I thought that the washer side was
            on the dryer side. I kept on pressed the wrong start button. But now
            that I understand how it works, I just ignore most of the controls and
            do the same thing every time.
          </li>
          <li>
            I wash all my clothes together. As long as it's not hot water, I'm fine.
            I then machine dry everything except for jeans and jackets. I'll usually
            dry on low, but I don’t know if it’s available on this one.
          </li>
          <li>
            Temperature setting, intensity for the washer. I guess whites and colors,
            but I always use colors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Well, both the start buttons look the same, and the washer/dryer labels
            are smaller than the settings around the wheel.
          </li>
          <li>
            It’s kind of a hassle, especially when I'm busy. I’m also just lazy.
          </li>

      <div class="user">
        <h4> Michael </h4>
        Observations:
        <ul>
          <li> Sorts through laundry basket and places specific items into washer. </li>
          <li> Looks through clothes inside washer, then selects delicates. </li>
          <li> Switches washer temperature to cold. </li>
          <li> Washes second batch (mostly sheets, some clothes) on heavy colors cycle </li>
          <li> Dries all laundry at once on delicates </li>

        </ul>
        Interview responses:
        <ol>
          <li>
            It’s a little busy. I’m not really sure how to use everything, so I wish
            the labels were clearer.
          </li>
          <li>
            I like to use delicate cycles for most of my clothes because I want to
            maintain them. I like low heat for the dryer. I usually split my clothes
            into lights and darks to prevent stains, but I also always use cold water
            for that.
          </li>
          <li>
            Temperature for both washer and dryer, something about how intense it
            washes, especially since it’s a top loading washer.
          </li>
          <li>
            I just don’t really know what it all means. Does light vs. heavy mean
            intensity of the wash or amount of water used? They’re separate settings
            on my laundry machine at home.
          </li>
          <li>
            I like taking care of my clothes. I have some nicer items and also
            some cheaper items that fall apart kind of easily, so I want to keep
            them looking good. I used to hand wash some of my clothes, but I'm way
            less concerned about that now.

      <h3> Part 3: Personas </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="part">
        I then took the data I collected from my roommates and developed two personas.
        The first is the Distracted Student.

      <div class="img">
        <img src="DS_Empathy_Map.jpg" width="450" height="500">
      </div>

      <p>
        The Distracted Student has a packed Google Calendar and does not have the
        energy to do laundry. They just want to get it over with, but they also
        will put it off for weeks on end. This persona struggles with the interface's
        complexity, wanting the laundry process to be as simple and obvious as possible.
        They may be so distracted that the first time they use the interface, they
        can't tell which controls are for the washer and which are for the dryer.
        The Distracted Student persona mainly represents Emily and Sophie. It
        draws from Emily's quotes during observation and her comment on laundry being
        a hassle when she's busy. It also draws from Sophie's comments on the
        settings feeling arbitrary and confusing, as well as her using her phone
        while doing laundry.
      </p>

      The second persona is the Careful Saver.

      <div class="img">
        <img src="CS_Empathy_Map.jpg" width="450" height="500">
      </div>

      <p>
        The Careful Saver wants to preserve their clothing and is willing to put
        in extra effort to do so. They make calculated choices for their laundry,
        which can sometimes even be a little nerve-wracking. This persona struggles
        with understanding what the components of the interface do. Unlike the
        Distracted Student, they want to know what the labels mean, and they prefer
        having more control over the cycle settings. The Careful Saver persona mainly
        represents Michael. Specifically, it
        draws from her quotes during observation and her comment on laundry being
        a hassle when she's busy. The persona also draws from Sophie's comments on the
        settings feeling arbitrary and her using her phone while doing laundry.

      <h3> Part 4: Storyboards </h3>

    <div class="part">
        As the final task, I designed a storyboard for the Distracted Student persona.

      <h3> Final Reflections </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="part">
        There are many lessons I'll take away from this project. For one, this is
        the first project I've done in college for which I've had to design visuals.
        I've learned some skills in Adobe XD and Plot, and I've also learned their
        limitations. I've also realized that I prefer digital visuals over hand-drawn
        ones, especially because my skills in hand drawing are so lacking. Lastly,
        I've learned how personas and storyboards help bolster each other. I started
        by developing the two personas, but by writing the narrative for the Distracted
        Student storyboard, I was able to better identify and focus on the key aspects
        of the persona.
